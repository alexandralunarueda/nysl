            <h3>Vision</h3>

            <h3>General Info</h3>
        <br>
        <p>The Northside Youth Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide
        athletes residing in Chicago's northside neighborhood an environment to
        learn and play soccer. To be a member of NYSL, you must be between
        the ages of 4-12 and reside in a Chicago northside neighborhood. NYSL is
        run by a small, full-time staff, and relies on the generous volunteer time
        of parents and former league members. </p>
